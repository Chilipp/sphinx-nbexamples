.. currentmodule:: sphinx_nbexamples

.. getting_started:

Getting started
===============

The module provides 2 additional configuration values.

.. confval:: process_examples

    If ``True``, (the default), then the notebook files are converted to rst.


.. confval:: example_gallery_config

    A dictionary with the parameters of the :class:`~sphinx_nbexamples.Gallery`
    class


By default, the sphinx-nbexamples package converts your jupyter notebook in a
specific directory into rst files to include it into your documentation. The
:confval:`process_examples` configuration value controls this conversion. If
switched off, no new files will be created.

The second configuration value, :confval:`example_gallery_config`, can be used
to control which examples are converted and how. They are simply the keyword
arguments for the :class:`~sphinx_nbexamples.Gallery` class, but we will go in
more detail in the next sections. But look into the :ref:`gallery_examples`
section to see the outcome of the gallery.


.. _nbstructure:

Structure of the notebooks
--------------------------
You are free to format your notebooks however you want. There are only 2
important features since we convert the notebook to a single html page:

1. The first cell must be a Markdown cell containing a title
2. The first cell should include a short summary which will then be shown as
   the tooltip in the summary


.. _basic_settings:

Choosing the examples
---------------------
The three keywords ``'examples_dirs'``, ``'gallery_dirs'``, and ``'pattern'`` can
be used to select which notebooks shall be converted. The value for
``'examples_dirs'`` is the path to the directory where your raw jupyter
notebooks are located. The ``'gallery_dirs'`` key on the other hand will point
to the directories where the converted notebooks will be. You can also provide
a list of example directories to create multiple galleries.

Finally the ``'pattern'`` corresponds to the filename pattern for the example
notebooks. Using the default pattern (``'example_.+.ipynb'``) implies, that
all your notebooks in the ``'examples_dirs'`` starts with ``'example_'``


.. _preprocessing:

Preprocessing the examples or not
---------------------------------
When converting the examples, the default behaviour is to process the examples
as well. This is a good possibility if you have an automatic building of the
docs (e.g. using readthedocs.org_) to check that all your examples really work.
However, you might not want this for all your notebooks, because it eventually
takes a lot of time to process all the notebooks or it requires additional
libraries. Therefore you can use the ``'preprocess'`` and ``'dont_preprocess'``
keys so select which examples are processed.


.. _thumbnails:

Choosing the thumbnail
----------------------
As you see in our :ref:`example gallery <gallery_examples>`, little thumbnails
are created for each notebook. They can be chosen via

1. the ``'code_examples'`` key in the :confval:`example_gallery_config`
2. the ``'code_example'`` key in the meta data of the notebook
3. the ``'thumbnail_figures'`` key in the :confval:`example_gallery_config`
4. the key ``'thumbnail_figure'`` in the meta data of the notebook
5. automatically from the last matplotlib figure in the example notebook

Hence, if you do not specify either ``'code_examples'`` nor
``'thumbnail_figure'`` (which is the default), it looks for a matplotlib
plot in the notebook and uses this one.

Otherwise, you have the possibility to give a small code sample via the
``'code_examples'``  or use the ``'thumbnail_figure'``. The latter can
be the path to a picture (relative to the notebook) or a number to specify
which figure of the matplotlib figures to use.


.. _supp:

Providing supplementary files
-----------------------------
Sphinx-nbexamples automatically inserts links to download the jupyter notebook
and the converted python file. However, often your example requires additional
data files, etc. Here, you have two possibilities:

1. Specify the external data in the metadata of your notebook (see the
   :ref:`gallery_examples_example_basic.ipynb`)
2. Specify the external data in the ``'supplementary_files'`` key of your
   :confval:`example_gallery_config` specific for each notebook


.. _nbviewer:

Including a link to the nbviewer
--------------------------------
If your notebooks are also published online, you can embed a link to the
wonderful `jupyter nbviewer`_ in the documentation. You have multiple options
here. You can either

1. specify the url for each notebook separately providing a mapping from
   notebook file to url in the ``'urls'`` option of the
   :confval:`example_gallery_config`
2. include a url item in the metadata of your notebook that points to
   the url of the notebook
3. specify one single url in the ``'urls'`` option of the
   :confval:`example_gallery_config` that will then be extended to the
   corresponding notebook path. For sphinx-nbexamples, this looks like::

       example_gallery_config = {
           urls='https://github.com/Chilipp/sphinx-nbexamples/blob/master/examples',
       }

.. _jupyter nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org


.. _binder:

Including a link to the binder
------------------------------
`Jupyters binderhub`_ allows to run the example notebooks of your repository
(see for example mybinder.org_). If your notebooks are also published online,
sphinx-nbexamples can add a badge like |binder| in the documentation.

You have multiple options here. You can either

1. specify the url for each notebook separately providing a mapping from
   notebook file to url in the ``'binder_urls'`` option of the
   :confval:`example_gallery_config`
2. include a binder_url item in the metadata of your notebook that points to
   the url of the notebook where it can be run interactively
3. specify one single url in the ``'binder_urls'`` option of the
   :confval:`example_gallery_config` that will then be extended to the
   corresponding notebook path. For sphinx-nbexamples at mybinder.org_, this
   looks like::

       example_gallery_config = {
           'binder_url': 'https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Chilipp/sphinx-nbexamples/master?filepath=examples',
       }

   or for the `pangeo binder`_::

       example_gallery_config = {
           'binder_url': 'https://binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/Chilipp/sphinx-nbexamples/master?filepath=examples',
       }

   See the binderhub service you use (e.g. mybinder.org_) for how to get this
   url for your repository. This will, e.g. for the
   :ref:`example_basic.ipynb <gallery_examples_example_basic.ipynb>` notebook,
   translate into::

       .. image:: https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg
           :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Chilipp/sphinx-nbexamples/master?filepath=examples/example_basic.ipynb

.. |binder| image:: https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg
    :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Chilipp/sphinx-nbexamples/master

.. _jupyters binderhub: https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
.. _mybinder.org: https://mybinder.org/
.. _pangeo binder: https://binder.pangeo.io/


.. _bokeh:

Including bokeh
---------------

.. warning::

    Bokeh is not working for the latest version (see `#10 <https://github.com/Chilipp/sphinx-nbexamples/issues/10>`_). PR's welcomed!

Note that bokeh needs a special treatment, especially when using the scheme
from readthedocs.org_, because it requires additional style sheets and javascript
files. So, if you have bokeh plots in your documentation, we recommend to

1. use the :func:`bokeh.io.output_notebook` function in your examples
2. disable the preprocessing for this notebook using the ``'dont_preprocess'``
   keyword
3. Give the bokeh version via the ``'insert_bokeh'`` keyword

If you furthermore use widgets from bokeh, use the ``'insert_bokeh_widgets'``
keyword, too.

.. note::

    We cannot extract a thumbnail figure for bokeh notebooks. Hence, you should
    provide it by yourself (see :ref:`thumbnails`).

.. _tag-removal:

Removing cells
--------------
Using notebook 5.0 and nbconvert 5.3 and higher, you can also tag cells
and specify them for removal in the converted rst file.

In the jupyter notebook click on
:menuselection:`View --> Cell Toolbar --> Tags` and assign a tag to the cell
you want to remove. You can then use one or more of the keywords

remove_all_outputs_tags
    removes all outputs
remove_cell_tags
    removes the entire cell
remove_input_tags
    removes the input and only keeps the output
remove_single_output_tags
    Removes an individual output

in the :confval:`example_gallery_config`. See the :class:`Gallery`
and :class:`nbconvert.preprocessors.Preprocessor` documentation for more
information.

To remove the entire cell, for example, set

.. code-block:: python

    example_gallery_config = {
        'remove_cell_tags': ['the-tag-of-the-cell-you-want-to-remove'],
        }

in the ``'conf.py'`` of your docs.
